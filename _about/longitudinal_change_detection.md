title:  "dMRI: Longitudinal Change Detection"

excerpt: "I'm working on estimation and testing tools on tensors along the white-matter pathways. I proposed two testing strategies: a pointwise test that compares at each sampling point of the fiber bundle the tensor populations of the two exams in the cross section of the bundle, and a fiberwise test that compares paired tensors along all the fiber bundle. Experiments on both synthetic and real data highlight the benefit of considering fiber based statistical tests compared to the standard voxelwise strategy."

Diffusion MRI is a new medical imaging modality of great interest in neuroimaging research. This modality enables the characterization in vivo of local micro-structures. Tensors have commonly been used to model the diffusivity profile at each voxel. This multivariate data set requires the design of new dedicated image processing techniques. The context of my thesis was the automatic analysis of intra-patient longitudinal changes with application to the follow-up of neuro-degenerative pathologies. New models and statistical tests for the automatic detection of changes in temporal sequences of diffusion images were developped. Tractography techniques that allows to probe brain connections in vivo were also used as priors.
